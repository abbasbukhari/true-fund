# TrueFund Frontend

This React app provides a UI for interacting with the TrueFund smart contract. It uses Vite, ethers.js, and wagmi for Ethereum wallet and contract integration.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Configure your contract address and ABI in `src/contractConfig.js`.

## Features

- Connect wallet (MetaMask)
- Interact with TrueFund contract (UI components to be added)

## Best Practices

- Follow Cyfrin/html-fund-me-cu integration patterns
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

---

For contract ABI and address, update `src/contractConfig.js`.
