# TrueFund

A blockchain-based donation platform for transparent, direct giving to verified recipients such as charities, mosques, or individuals in need. Built as a learning project to explore smart contract development, security, and best practices.

## üöÄ Project Overview

TrueFund allows an admin to register recipient wallets for organizations. Donors can send ETH directly to these wallets, with every donation tracked on-chain via events. Funds never stay in the contract, ensuring maximum transparency and trust.

### üåç Multi-Currency Donation Support

Donors can donate using their local currencies. The contract uses Chainlink price feeds to convert local currency amounts to the required ETH value. Supported currencies at launch:

- USD (ETH/USD)
- CAD (ETH/CAD)
- GBP (ETH/GBP)
- HKD (ETH/HKD)
- PKR (ETH/PKR)

The contract is designed to easily add more price feeds and currencies as the project grows.

## ‚ú® Features

- Admin can register verified recipient wallets
- Donors send ETH directly to recipients
- Donors can specify donation amount in their local currency (ETH value calculated via price feed)
- Every donation emits an on-chain event for transparency
- No funds held in the contract
- Public, verifiable donation history
- Easily extensible to support more currencies and price feeds

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd true-fund
   forge install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file for RPC URLs and private keys (if needed)

## üß™ Usage

- Build contracts:
  ```sh
  forge build
  ```
- Run tests:
  ```sh
  forge test
  ```
- Deploy contracts (example):
  ```sh
  forge script script/DeployTrueFund.s.sol --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> --private-key <your_private_key>
  ```

## üéØ Learning Objectives

**Status:** üü° Learning in Progress

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
